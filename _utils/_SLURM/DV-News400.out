Some weights of the model checkpoint at /nfs/home/ernstd/models/llava-v1.6-mistral-7b-hf/ were not used when initializing LlavaForConditionalGeneration: ['image_newline']
- This IS expected if you are initializing LlavaForConditionalGeneration from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing LlavaForConditionalGeneration from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
